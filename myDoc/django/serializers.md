Serializers in Django (specifically Django REST Framework) are needed to:

Convert complex data types (like Django models) to Python data types that can be easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types for APIs.
Validate incoming data before saving it to the database.
Control which fields are exposed and how they are represented in API responses.
Handle creation and updating of model instances from incoming API data.
Summary:
Serializers make it easy to transform, validate, and manage data between your Django models and API endpoints.
