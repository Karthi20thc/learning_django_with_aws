To implement a rollback when inserting into a second table fails, you should use Django’s **database transaction management**. This ensures that if any part of your multi-step database operation fails, all previous changes are undone (rolled back).

Use `transaction.atomic()` for this:

````python
from django.db import transaction, DatabaseError

def create_user_and_profile(user_data, profile_data):
    try:
        with transaction.atomic():
            user = UserModel.objects.create(**user_data)
            # If the next line fails, the user creation above will be rolled back
            profile = ProfileModel.objects.create(user=user, **profile_data)
        return {"success": True}
    except DatabaseError as e:
        # Handle the error, rollback happens automatically
        return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
````

**How it works:**
- All operations inside `with transaction.atomic():` are treated as a single transaction.
- If any exception occurs (e.g., second table insertion fails), all changes are rolled back.
- No partial data is saved.

**Summary:**  
Wrap your multi-table insertions in `with transaction.atomic():` to ensure rollback on failure.

Q2 : let say i want to insert data into a table, but there is already an operation is running, is there is any way i can read that in python django and throw some error


Yes, in Django (and databases in general), if another operation (like an insert/update/delete) is running on the same row or table and holds a **lock**, and you attempt another conflicting operation, your query can:

* **wait (block)** until the lock is released,
* **fail with an error** (if you set it up to do so), or
* **detect the lock status programmatically** (though not always straightforward).

To **detect if another operation is running and throw an error**, here are some options depending on your use case and database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.):

---

### ✅ Option 1: Use `select_for_update()` with `nowait=True`

> Works with PostgreSQL & some support in other DBs

This will try to acquire a lock, and **fail immediately** if another transaction is already holding a lock.

```python
from django.db import transaction
from django.db.utils import OperationalError
from myapp.models import MyModel

try:
    with transaction.atomic():
        obj = MyModel.objects.select_for_update(nowait=True).get(id=1)
        # Proceed with your insert/update
except OperationalError:
    # Another transaction is locking this row
    raise Exception("Another operation is currently running. Please try again later.")
```

---

### ✅ Option 2: Application-level locking using cache (e.g., Redis or Memcached)

You can simulate a lock by setting a cache key before your operation starts:

```python
from django.core.cache import cache

lock_key = "my_table_insert_lock"

if cache.get(lock_key):
    raise Exception("Insert operation already in progress.")

try:
    cache.set(lock_key, True, timeout=10)  # lock for 10 seconds
    # Proceed with insert operation
finally:
    cache.delete(lock_key)
```

> This doesn't depend on DB-level locks and is useful for custom, high-level logic control.

---

### ✅ Option 3: PostgreSQL advisory locks

> More advanced, works only with PostgreSQL.

You can use PostgreSQL’s advisory locking mechanism.

```python
from django.db import connection

def acquire_pg_advisory_lock(key):
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT pg_try_advisory_lock(%s)", [key])
        locked = cursor.fetchone()[0]
        if not locked:
            raise Exception("Another operation is running.")

def release_pg_advisory_lock(key):
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT pg_advisory_unlock(%s)", [key])
```

Use the `acquire_pg_advisory_lock` before the insert and call `release_pg_advisory_lock` after.

### Summary

| Method                           | DB Support                | Detect Lock | Good For                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| `select_for_update(nowait=True)` | PostgreSQL, partial MySQL | ✅ Yes       | Row-level operations            |
| Cache-based lock                 | Any                       | ✅ Yes       | App-level logic (e.g. inserts)  |
| Advisory locks                   | PostgreSQL only           | ✅ Yes       | Global/table-level coordination |

Let me know what DB you're using (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.), and I can tailor this more specifically.
